The repository now has Gatsby Docs!

This is exciting because you'll be able to document all the things in this nice, pretty site.  Remember: **if it's not documented, it doesn't exist**.

The docs come with a few "flavors" of documentation.  This is a blog post, and can be used to track when things change in the repo.  For instance, maybe the build command has changed, or perhaps the way we do a certain task (like generating code) has changed.  These blog posts are good for that.  They help communicate changes, new features, etc, to other developers (remember that you + two weeks = a new developer).  A developer should be able to step away from the project and review the blog to find out what's changed.

This is as opposed to the main docs or "books", which are for guides, ADRs, FAQs, etc.  They are intended as a point in time record of the current state of the repository at the given commit.  A new developer would skip the blog and just jump into the project.
