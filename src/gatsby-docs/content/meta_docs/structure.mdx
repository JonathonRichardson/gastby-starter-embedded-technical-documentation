The documentation is seperated into multiple "guides".  Each book has it's own left nav structure, and can contain information on a certain aspect of the project.  For instance, the template starts out with several guides:

- How-To Guides
  - Instructions regarding specific tasks that developers need to do from time to time.
- Getting Started
  - How to set up a development machine and get the project running.

Other common guides to add might include reference guides, architectural overviews, or style guides.

## Source control

Each book is contained in the `src/gatsby-docs/content/` directory.  Each subdirectory there represents one book.

## Nav Tree

The left nav tree for each book mirrors the directory structure of the underlying source files.  The filename will determine the `slug` for the page, which will be the value displayed in the URL.

You can nest pages by placing them in a folder with the same name as the page you want to nest them under, but without the `.md`/`.mdx` extension.  For instance, to place a new page underneath a page with a filename of `components.tsx`, you would create a folder called `components/` and place your new `.mdx` file in that new folder.

The name of the page will be determined by the `title` attribute in the frontmatter section of that page.  The order that nodes appear is alphabetical by filename, but can be overriden by including a `navOrder` attribute in the frontmatter for that page.  Anything without a `navOrder` will sort after pages with explicit `navOrder` set.

## Adding New pages

To add a new page to a book, simply create a new `.mdx` file in the directory corresponding to the parent page for you new page.

Make sure to add a frontmatter section with the title at the top:
