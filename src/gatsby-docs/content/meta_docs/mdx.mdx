Content for this documentation is authored as `.mdx` files.  [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is an extension of markdown that allows embedding JSX and HTML directly into markdown files, which allows for customization when the default markdown syntax just isn't enough.

This allows for documentation to be written in easily readable/writable markdown for most documentation, but with added flexibility for that 1% of the time that you need to add something more complicated to the docs.

Gatsby provides [pretty good documentation of MDX on their site](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/writing-pages/), as well as on [the official site](https://mdxjs.com/), so check those out.
