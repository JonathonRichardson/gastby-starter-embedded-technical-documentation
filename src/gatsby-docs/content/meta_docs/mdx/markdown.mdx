MDX, by default, is based on the standardized [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) "flavor" of markdown.  This is for the most part the same as other markdown implementations in the basics, such as you might use on GitHub.  If you are unfamiliar with the syntax, check out [this cheatsheet](https://commonmark.org/help/) or the "[10 Minute Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)", which has interactive demos.

If you're feeling particularly nerdy, you can also check out the [official specs](https://spec.commonmark.org/).
