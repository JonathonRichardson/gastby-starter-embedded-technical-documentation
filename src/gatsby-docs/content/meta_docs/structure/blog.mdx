The blog is meant for communication between developers.  Whenever you make major changes to the project, you can use the blog to inform other developers
of the changes made to the source code.

The idea is that while the guides provide a point in time look at the documentation, the blog can serve as release notes.  I find that simply
writing release notes here can be very useful to organize thoughts and help communicate major changes (such as process changes) to other developers.

It also serves as a quick one stop shop for someone who doesn't work on the project every day to step back into the fold and not miss a beat.

Obviously not everything needs to be documented in the blog, just things that will majorly affect other developers and workflows.  This isn't
meant for end user release notes (although you could certainly use it for that), but intended for contributors to the project to be the main
audience.
