This page provides the gritty details of how the mdx files end up as pages.  If you're just looking to write documentation, you don't need this information.

This is only really valuable if you want to hack on the starter/template itself.

# Overview

The `gatsby-config.ts` iterates over all the books defined in the `content/books.ts`, as well as the blog folder (which is hard coded there), and adds those folders with the `gatsby-source-filesystem`.  This makes these files available in graphql under the top level object `allFile`.

Then, we also include the `gatsby-plugin-mdx`, which maps these into the `allMdx` node in graphql.

This then needs to get turned into nodes and pages.  The new pages are created in the `createPages` method of `gatsby-node.js`.  This function queries the current mdx files and creates a page for each node, which consists of the component template to use to render the page (e.g. `BlogPageTemplate.tsx` for blog pages and `MDXDocumentTemplate.mdx` for regular book pages) and a little metadata.
