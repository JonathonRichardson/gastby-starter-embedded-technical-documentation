Search is enabled by default in these documents.  Simply type your query into the search bar in the application toolbar.

This local search is fast and serverless, but it comes with a downside: there is no preview of the context of your search results.  However, you can always just click on the result and then Ctrl+F on the landing page.

You can also use the search feature in VSCode to search the source control for what you're looking for.

If you are deploying this documentation, you can potentially use the Elasticsearch plugins to implement search functionality that includes contextual preview of the search results.
