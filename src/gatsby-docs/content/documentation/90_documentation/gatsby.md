# Overview

The Gatsby docs is the documentation you are currently reading, if you are reading this.  Gatsby is a utility that takes Markdown, MDX, and javascript, and compiles them into a static website.

# Source Control

While each developer could recompile the docs on their machine every time they update, Gatsby can be a little slow to get started, so it's faster and more efficient to both store the input (source of truth) files as well as the compiled output.

This means that if you want to make any updates to the documentation, you should also recompile the docs after doing so, before submitting your PR for review.
