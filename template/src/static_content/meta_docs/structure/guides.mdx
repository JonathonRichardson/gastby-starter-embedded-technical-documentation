Guides are what you traditionally think of as documentation.  Each guide has it's own left have structure, and should generally focus on
one topic.

HTFM ships with a couple default guides that are generally needed by every project:

|Guide Name|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|Getting Started|How to set up a development machine and get the project running.|
|How-Tos|Instructions regarding specific tasks that developers will commonly perform.|
|HTFM|Meta Documentation on the HTFM project.  If you make customizations, you should update this.|

Other common guides to add might include reference guides, architectural overviews, or style guides.

## Nav Tree

The left nav tree for each book mirrors the directory structure of the underlying source files.  The filename will determine the `slug` for the page, which will be the value displayed in the URL.

You can nest pages by placing them in a folder with the same name as the page you want to nest them under, but without the `.md`/`.mdx` extension.  For instance, to place a new page underneath a page with a filename of `components.tsx`, you would create a folder called `components/` and place your new `.mdx` file in that new folder.

The name of the page will be determined by the `title` attribute in the frontmatter section of that page.  The order that nodes appear is alphabetical by filename, but can be overriden by including a `navOrder` attribute in the frontmatter for that page.  Anything without a `navOrder` will sort after pages with explicit `navOrder` set.

## Adding New pages

To add a new page to a guide, simply create a new `.mdx` file in the directory corresponding to the parent page for you new page.

Make sure to add a frontmatter section with the required title at the top:

```
---
title: "New Component Page"
---
```

To add subpages, create a directory with the same name as the `.mdx` file you want it to nest under (`search` for `search.mdx`), and add
pages as normal to this subdirectory.

## Adding New Guides

To add a new guide, create a new directory in `src/gatsby-docs/content/` and add a new entry for the guide to `guides.ts`.
