Documentation is a critical component for any project, be it a library or application, to help contributers (e.g. developers) and users understand and work with the code.

HTFM means to help reduce the friction in maintaining documentation by creating an easy to use template that works out of the box to provide everything you need for documentation, while leaving room for developers to be able to customize it however they need.

# Principles

## If It's Not Documented, It Doesn't Exist

People won't usually read the code itself or explore the app to try to find something: it needs to be documented.  All the hard work and development time is all for naught if no one knows about it.

## The Best Bus Factor is 0

The "bus factor" of a contributer to a project is the degree to which the project would be crippled if that person <s>was suddenly hit by a bus</s> suddenly wanted to take vacation for a 4-week bus tour of Europe.

Properly documenting the project makes it far easier for others to contribute and/or take over projects by making secret "tribal knowledge" and making it available for everyone.

## You + 2 Weeks â‰  You

Even if you're the only person working on a project, it's really hard to think back even two weeks, let alone years.  Documentation helps your future self remember what's important and how to interact with a project.
